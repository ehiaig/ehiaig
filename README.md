### Hi there, I'm Ehi 👋
Thank you for stopping by my profile today.

💬 I like to discuss Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Python and Php.

Ps. Although these days, I think I'm falling in love with vuejs 🤫(Don't tell anyone!).

✨ I believe that there is so much left to build... and I'm looking to collaborate and contribute to building a future where AI can be leveraged to serve people, create value, and improve quality of life.

🔭 Whenever I'm not building, you can find me learning Spanish, French or by the beach side eating turkey with a glass of yogurt.🌱😋

⚡ Currently, I drive engineering at [Vesicash](https://vesicash.com) and I write technical articles at [devMoment](https://devmoment.com)

#### I can help you with:

    Technical writing 📝
    Computer Vision tasks 👁
    Manage your tech team
